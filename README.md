Legejo [Le-Gay-O] is the name of my app. In Esperanto it means "reading place". The goal of the app is to allow the user to read an article in Esperanto and click on words they don't understand. That way they get the definition. If they deem the word worthy of reviewing,  they have the option of saving it on a list that they will have access to.
User Story: "As an  intermediate level Esperanto speaker, I want to be exposed to Esperanto text in realistic contexts and expand my vocabulary."
